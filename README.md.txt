# 🚦 Traffic Light Control using Arduino

This project demonstrates a simple traffic light system using an Arduino board and three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green).

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Red LED
- Yellow LED
- Green LED
- 3 × 220Ω Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Yellow LED turns ON for 1 second
- Green LED turns ON for 1 second
- Red LED turns ON for 1 second
- Message is printed to Serial Monitor

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Digital Output
- pinMode & digitalWrite
- Delay timing
- Serial communication

## 🧪 Code
See `traffic_light.ino`
